  h6(class="bold text-left") Hints
  h6(class="text-left") &bull; Be careful about dissociating solutes
  h6(class="text-left") &bull; All solutions are treated as ideal
  h6(class="text-left") &bull; It is assumed there are not additional processes beyond the possible solute dissociation
  h6(class="text-left") &bull; You should continue to work on a problem until you get it correct, but you can get a new problem at any time.
