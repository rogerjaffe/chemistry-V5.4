<div>This exercise uses the Rydberg equation as the basis for posing questions related to the electronic energy levels of the hydrogen atom. You will need to use your textbook to obtain the Rydberg equation as well as several other needed expressions and constants. A very specific dimension set is used. Energies are always in Joules, wavelength in meters and frequency in sec<sup>-1</sup>. Determine the value of the answer (remember the dimension restrictions), enter it on the cell and press the "Check Answer" button.</div>
