<div>This is a drill and practice page about predicting the result of a conversion. This is totally noncalculational so put away the calculator. You'll get a quantity and a starting dimension as well as the dimension into which the starting quantity is to be converted. Predict whether the new numeric quantity resulting from the conversion will be larger, smaller or the same as the given quantity and click on the circle in front of the appropriate term. For example, "1.23 feet to miles" would be correctly answered by "smaller".</div>
