div This page is an exercise in using combining equilibria. Below you'll see a set of equations with Ks and a question. Calculate the needed equilibrium constant. This page is complex, but it's not intended to be tricky. Thus, no attempt has been made to mislead you. There should be a straightforward combination of the contributing reactions which yields the desired reaction. This page uses the "e" convention for entering numbers in scientific notation. Thus, 1.2 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> would be entered as 1.2e3
