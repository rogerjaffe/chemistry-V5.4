<div>This is an exercise in calculating standard potential.</div><div class="small-print">An unbalanced redox process with a question will appear below. Be careful about the dimensions, the cathode/anode and the direction of spontaneity. You will need a table of standard potentials to answer the question and you can assume all molarities and pressures are at unity</div>
