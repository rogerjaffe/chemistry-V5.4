h5.heading This is a basic exercise in naming simple binary compounds. Since its effective use requires analysis of text input there are some basic rules:

div.question
  ul.list
    li This page does not contain any transition elements and, thus, stock notation is not used.
    li Spelling matters very much. No effort has been made to analyze input against possible spelling errors. There is a button below which can be pushed to display the spelling of all polyatomic ions used on this page.
    li Capitalization does not matter, the page can adjust for improper capitalization.
    li All compounds on this page can be viewed as simple binary compounds.
    li For those combinations for which prefixes are not needed,e.g. CaCl2, their use will result in an error.

  h5.heading Operation:
